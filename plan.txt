first, i want to test the engine,
by making a big fancy remake of my snake game with A* (a star) pathfinding, but way better.

(possible sidequest where i implement the this: https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/research/projects/avbd/)

then i want to make a real playable game,
first idea i had, was a game similar to bad piggies,
where you assemble a vehicle in a fun puzzle/engineering type
coolness.

(possible sidequest where i implement skeletal animations)

then, i make absolute mania, 
a game all about dynamic gameplay, where you design your own weapons,
and the main objective is to encourage as much creative problem solving as possible,
by making sure there are MANY ways to solve a problem, and only hinting to the player how to do it.

i also want it to be a vr game, but that can come after i actually make it fun
