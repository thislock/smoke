i want a 3d graphics engine capable of editing anything in real time,
this includes models, logic, lighting, and textures,
going between editing and playing should be seemless, and easy requiring no more than a button press.

i also want a decent effect system, 3d fire, lightning, water dripping, particles
just some spice to design, that'll make everything look more alive

ideally, also:
(bonus stuff that would be cool, but could easily creep up on me, so are low priority)
i would want a custom wrapper i could use to easily port any games to other platforms *note, mostly solved by using wgpu, allowing fallback to webasm/opengl/vulkan/metal*
auto benchmarking to determine graphics settings, switching api's automatically, for example:
older platforms may have better opengl performance than vulkan, so the idea is that it will autodetect
that the performance is better, or maybe just more stable, and switch over before the game fully loads
