please keep in mind: this is a work in progress project

one-engine is another subject to the pile of the infinite abyss of obscure game engines,
however, unlike other game engines [cough cough, unity] this one is being built from the ground up, to maximise performance,
creative control, and an easy hotloadible system.

the point of this project is not to replace godot or unreal or [INSERT OTHER POSSIBLY DASTARDLY POPULAR GAME ENGINE]
this is just made for my creative side, because ever since i was a wee lad, i've wanted to make a cool video game,
but most game engines don't cut it for me, because they focus too hard on photorealism, and my inner child won't allow that.

now, what does this mean for you, hypothetical user of this (at the time of writing) useless game engine?
well, if you want next gen graphics, this is your sign to politely leave.

B U T, now that those grown up weaklings are gone, if you like the idea of an engine built from the ground up,
with stylised rendering, and performance in mind, along with editing shaders and logic WHILE the game is still running?
then, my liitle kid-like middle aged hairy gooner baby man, YOUR IN LUCK! (if my hypothetical adhd and autism can cooperate long enough to finish this of course!)

i plan on releasing my own games using this engine, if your here because of that, hello! (you arn't getting a free copy of my game by compiling this code little timmy)
this is under the MIT license, it's boring to limit peoples creativity, so sell your games made with this and whatever, i love to see it!
